CoreWar in F#
=============

This project is an implementation of [Core War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War) in F#, mainly as an exercise to teach myself the language.

Current features:
-----------------
* Basic Redcode parser
* Implementations of MOV, NOP, DAT, ADD, SUB, MUL, MOD, DIV (although some are untested)
* A *very* simple REPL and core dump routine

Still to do:
------------
* More instruction implementations
* Memory Visualisation

Dependencies:
-------------
* FSParsec
